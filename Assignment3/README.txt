CPSC 350-01
Assignment 3

Source Files:
GenStack.h, (GenStack.cpp), SyntaxCheck.h, SyntaxCheck.cpp, main.cpp

Challenges:
The entire assignment runs and works on inputed file. However, I made a Makefile.new to try to implement
a reference from the template class of GenStack to its own .cpp file. Yet to have figured it out.

Resources:
I used the textbook and the first [1] link below to get a better understanding of template classes. I was trying
to use the 3rd [3] link to figure out a way to make the template class inside a .cpp file. I was getting an error
that said undefined reference, however I used the second [2] link to put all my implementations onto the header
file rather than a .cpp.
