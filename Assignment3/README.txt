CPSC 350-01
Assignment 3

Source Files:
GenStack.h, SyntaxCheck.h, SyntaxCheck.cpp, main.cpp

Challenges:
I was getting an error that said undefined reference, however I used the second [2] link
to put all my implementations onto the header file rather than a .cpp.

Resources:
I used the textbook and the first [1] link below to get a better understanding of template classes.
