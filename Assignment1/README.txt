Assignment 1

Source Files:
DNA.h, DNA.cpp, main.cpp

Challenges:
No compiler errors or run time errors when running the program. Has no problems as far as I know.

Resources:
I used the websites listed below to figure out the input and output of files. I also used websites
to get the random number seeding as well as getting it to set random number between 0 and 1. To get a better
understanding of how the seeding works. Used all the equations from the assignment document.
