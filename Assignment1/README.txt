Assignment 1

Source Files:
DNA.h, DNA.cpp, main.cpp

Challenges:
Although the program runs and does what its supposed to do, a challenge that I came across when doing this
assignment was trying to get the random variables to work with the box muller method as well as the
gaussian distribution. I found out that I had to us the address operator '&' to update the random integer
each time the for loop iterates.

Resources:
I used the websites listed below to figure out the input and output of files. I also used websites
to get the random number seeding as well as getting it to set random number between 0 and 1. To get a better
understanding of how the seeding works. Used all the equations from the assignment document.
