Challenges:
In my code, I used Columns first then Rows when iterating through the 2D arrays, but it works the same.
I keep getting this error when the user doesn't press the enter key, it gets an aborted error.
The file input/output doesn't work also. I am capable of making the file input, just didn't give it enough time
because I was trying to make sure everything worked.

Resources:
I worked with Alberto Ng with some of the grid generations. For default and overloaded constructors.
