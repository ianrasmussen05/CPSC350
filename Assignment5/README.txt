Assignment 5

Source Files: TreeNode.h, BinarySearchTree.h, ListNode.h, LinkedList.h, Student.h,
              Student.cpp, Faculty.h, Faculty.cpp, Simulation.h. Simulation.cpp, main.cpp

Challenges:
The program successfully compiles and runs fine. I was unable to do the rollback function
in my program does not work. Use the two text files in the directory to read and input
new students and faculty.

Resources:
The first [1] source gave me a better understanding of binary trees and how they are used.
The second [2] showed me how the successor is implemented in the BST. The third [3] showed me
how to append a line to a file.
