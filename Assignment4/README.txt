Assignment 4

Source Files: ListNode.h, LinkedList.h, Queue.h, Student.h, Student.cpp, Window.h, Window.cpp, Simulation.h, Simulation.cpp, main.cpp

Challenges:
My program compiles, should be no errors. The only challenge I had in this assignment was trying to get the wait times to work properly.
I was getting bad C++ numbers for a while, but I limited it to more realistic numbers in my statistics.

Resources:
The first [1] resource is the sort() function used to sort my doubly linked list in Simulation.cpp. The second [2] link allowed me to
find the median of time waited for students. The textbook [3] was a great resource for doubly linked lists and queues.
